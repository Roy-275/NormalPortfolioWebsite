            <p>
                I am a student of Jahangirnagar University. Currently I'm in 2nd year in Department of Public Health and Informatics. So, I consider myself as a public health specialist. As a student of public health I like to take part in data collection via our seniors or sometimes I participate at the survey. I have worked as a Research Assistant in various research project which were studied by our seniors, collaborated with our respected teachers. I am currently thinking about starting a new research project of my own.
                Besides, I have learnt front end web developing as a hobby. And I would like to contribute by this skill also.
                I have several skillset. I have advanced level knowledge in MS Office360. In addition I have knowledge about video editing. I have basic skill of Adobe Ps and Ai.
                As of club work, I am working in JUSC as a general member since 2019. I have also worked in JUSC 6th Math Olympiad as a volunteer and examiner of exam paper.
                I want to select Public Health Specialist as my career. I want to work in that field to serve our people. Besides I want to contribute my time into research projects more and more. Because as a Public Health Specialist I have to work with the community and research for health related problems and find a solution for that will be great for the community.
